## Introduction

Welcome to the **CCF-canadian-climate-framing** repository. This project is dedicated to studying media coverage of climate change in the Canadian press through the most comprehensive machine-learning-preprocessed corpus of climate discourse available for research. The **[CCF Database](https://github.com/antoinelemor/CCF-canadian-climate-framing/blob/main/paper/CCF_Methodology/Latex/CCF_Methodology.pdf)** comprises 283,964 articles from 22 Canadian news outlets (1978–2026) processed into 9,908,776 sentence-level analytical units with 65 hierarchical annotations, achieving a macro F1 score of 0.866 across all categories. This is the first initiative of this scale in Canada known to the authors.

This work focuses on identifying and extracting a multitude of information by annotating the full texts of articles at the sentence level in order to analyze their complete content in the most detailed way, over time and across different Canadian regions and media outlets. We annotate [more than 60 categories](#what-do-we-annotate-and-extract-from-texts-) including eight main frames (economic, health, security, justice, political, scientific, environmental, cultural), actor networks, climate events, policy responses, emotional tone, and geographic focus. The deposited database is implemented in PostgreSQL and combines six relational tables — two sentence-level tables (`CCF_full_data`, `CCF_processed_data`), two article-level rollups (`CCF_article_aggregates` for the 65 per-article proportions, `CCF_article_entities` for the named-entity rollup), a per-category reliability lookup (`CCF_reliability_tiers`), and a `pgvector` table of BAAI/bge-m3 sentence embeddings (`CCF_sentence_embeddings`, 10.19 million 1024-dimensional vectors with HNSW cosine indexing) — so researchers can write either fine-grained sentence-level queries, fast article-level aggregations, or semantic-similarity searches without rewriting the same joins on every project.

This repository contains the annotation pipeline, the reporting pipeline, the training-data CSVs, the manuscript sources, and the figure / table outputs that accompany the paper. The deposited database itself is hosted on Zenodo (see [Citation](#citation)).

### The database

This repository documents a continuously updated database of climate change articles from 22 major Canadian news outlets — the 20 daily newspapers of the original corpus plus CBC.ca and Radio-Canada.ca, the public broadcaster's news sites (covered from 2023 onwards) — for a total of n = 283,964 articles covering the period 1978–2026 (corpus cut-off: 31 July 2026). Due to copyright restrictions on newspaper content, the raw sentence text is not redistributed here; the deposited database contains the article-level metadata (title, author, publication date, newspaper, page number), the sentence-level identifiers, the 65 binary annotations per sentence, the named-entity extractions, the article-level aggregates, the reliability tiers, and the BGE-M3 embeddings. Any researcher with institutional access to Factiva, Eureka.cc, or ProQuest Canadian Major Dailies can recover the original text from the bibliographic coordinates we provide.

The deposit is hosted on **Zenodo** under a CC-BY 4.0 licence in two complementary editions sharing identical schemas: (i) the canonical PostgreSQL edition (version DOI `10.5281/zenodo.22019287`; concept DOI **[`10.5281/zenodo.20346363`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20346363)**, which always resolves to the latest version), shipping as a single tarball `CCF_Database.tar` (≈ 40 GB) wrapping a `pg_dump -Fd` directory archive of the six relational tables together with all B-tree, partial and HNSW indexes (restoration requires PostgreSQL 16 or 17 with `pgvector ≥ 0.8.2`); and (ii) a column-oriented **Apache Parquet** mirror (version DOI `10.5281/zenodo.22019288`; concept DOI **[`10.5281/zenodo.20346372`](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20346372)**, one ZSTD-compressed file per table, ≈ 17.5 GB), readable directly with `pandas`, `polars`, R/`arrow`, DuckDB, or Spark without any database server. The only adaptation in Parquet is that the `halfvec(1024)` sentence-embedding column is materialised as a 1024-element `LIST<FLOAT>` and JSONB entity arrays are serialised as UTF-8 JSON strings. The companion code, documentation, manual annotations, and reproducible pipeline are archived in a dedicated Zenodo code deposit (DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21921214`) and additionally bundled with both data editions as `ccf_code_and_paper.tar.gz` (the bundle is assembled from this repository by `Scripts/Database_creation/enrichment/07_build_code_package.py`). The database is now refreshed on Zenodo roughly **every six months** by the CCF observatory's continuous extraction–annotation pipeline; the concept DOIs above always point to the most recent release. The table below shows the distribution of articles per outlet (after filtering and preprocessing), and the figure shows the geographic distribution of articles across Canada.

## The project's main idea and objectives

> **The overarching goal of the project is to establish the first pan-Canadian database—comprehensive across time and space—of media articles on climate change, and to perform an in-depth sentence-level analysis of each article's content.**

The primary purpose is to understand the determinants of climate change media coverage in Canada, in order to inform future research and, ultimately, enhance communication on this topic.

To carry out this overarching research idea, the project is organized around the following objectives, which are currently underway:

| Objective | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Establish a comprehensive pan-Canadian database of climate change media articles** | Establish a comprehensive and representative database covering the entire country's media landscape with historical coverage across both time and space. | **Completed** |
| **Deploy an advanced sentence-level annotation pipeline** | Deploy an annotation pipeline that combines the precision of manual annotations and the scale of machine learning along with named entity extraction to process and annotate articles at the sentence level. | **Completed** |
| **Implement a rigorous, scientifically robust validation process for machine learning models** | Conduct comprehensive performance evaluations using statistical analyses and manual annotations to verify high classification accuracy and ensure research-grade reliability. | **Completed** |
| **Publish the database and initial analyses** | Release the processed database and preliminary research findings for public use. | *In Progress* |

## Methodology

The research workflow is organised in five phases, each backed by deterministic and idempotent scripts. The full pipeline runs end-to-end on a single Apple Mac Studio (M2 Ultra, 128 GB unified memory); the sentence-embedding ingestion at step 09 is the dominant cost.

1. **Data acquisition and initial corpus.** The dataset comprises 283,964 climate-related articles from 22 major Canadian news outlets (20 daily newspapers plus CBC.ca and Radio-Canada.ca, covered from 2023 onwards) covering the period 1978–2026, with a corpus cut-off at 31 July 2026. The articles were retrieved through institutional subscriptions to Factiva, Eureka.cc, and ProQuest Canadian Major Dailies using a small set of bilingual Boolean keywords (`"climate change"`, `"global warming"`, `"climate crisis"`, ..., and their French equivalents). *Raw article text is not redistributed here due to copyright restrictions.*

2. **Preprocessing.** `Scripts/Annotation/01_Preprocess.py` segments each article into two-sentence sliding-window units using language-specific spaCy models (`en_core_web_lg` for English, `fr_dep_news_trf` for French), and `Scripts/Annotation/02_JSONL.py` writes the JSONL needed for manual annotation. Duplicate articles are removed with a 95 % fuzzy-similarity threshold, articles shorter than 100 words are discarded, and fastText verifies language assignment.

3. **Database population.** `Scripts/Annotation/05_populate_SQL_database.py` builds the initial PostgreSQL database with two tables: `CCF_full_data` (article-level metadata for the 283,964 documents) and `CCF_processed_data` (9,908,776 two-sentence units with all annotation columns).

4. **Annotation training and corpus annotation.** A single expert annotator labelled 4,000 sentences (1,927 English + 2,073 French) covering all 65 categories using `Scripts/Annotation/03_Manual_annotations.py` and `Scripts/Annotation/04_JSONL_for_training.py`. `Scripts/Annotation/06_Training_best_models.py` trains 128 BERT-base / CamemBERT-base classifiers (one per category × language) through the [Augmented Social Scientist](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00491241221134526) framework, with an automated reinforced training phase triggered when the positive-class F1 falls below 0.60 during normal training (45 of 128 models triggered the reinforcement). `Scripts/Annotation/07_Annotation.py` applies the trained models to the entire corpus, and `Scripts/Annotation/08_NER.py` adds Named Entity Recognition (PER / ORG / LOC) using a hybrid pipeline (BERT-base-NER for English, spaCy `fr_core_news_lg` + CamemBERT-NER for French). `Scripts/Annotation/09_create_sentence_embeddings.py` then ingests the BAAI/bge-m3 sentence embeddings into the `CCF_sentence_embeddings` table (`halfvec(1024)` via `pgvector`) and provisions an HNSW cosine index over the 10,192,740 vectors.

5. **Validation and quality control.** `Scripts/Annotation/10_JSONL_for_recheck.py` builds a 1,000-sentence stratified validation set with root-inverse probability weighting, `Scripts/Annotation/11_Annotation_metrics.py` benchmarks the model output against the gold standard, `Scripts/Annotation/12_Blind_verification.py` strips labels for a blind second-coder pass, `Scripts/Annotation/13_Intercoder_reliability.py` computes Cohen's κ, Krippendorff's α, and Gwet's AC1 per category and overall, and `Scripts/Annotation/14_create_intercoder_progression_plot.py` produces the intercoder-progression figure.

6. **Reporting.** Scripts 15, 16, and 17 normalise the canonical CSVs and generate every reproducible table of the manuscript and Supplementary Information: Tables 3 and 4 plus the inter-coder block for the main, and Supplementary Tables S4--S12 for the SI. The manuscript LaTeX sources (`CCF_Methodology.tex` and `CCF_Methodology_SI.tex`) live in `paper/CCF_Methodology/Latex/` and `\input{}` the generated tables directly; both documents are edited by hand.

## What do we annotate and extract from texts ?

> **We annotate at the sentence level 65 categories organized hierarchically (frames, actors, events, solutions, emotions, etc.). See Supplementary Table S3 in the [methodology paper](paper/CCF_Methodology/Latex/CCF_Methodology_SI.pdf) for complete definitions.**

The manual-annotation JSONL files listed above (`Annotated_sentences.jsonl`, `blind_verification.jsonl`, `consensus_gold_standard.jsonl`, together with the `annotation_bases/` directory) are published with the repository: they contain only short excerpts (two-sentence units) reproduced for research purposes, which falls under the fair dealing exception for research of the Canadian Copyright Act (s. 29).

The reviewer correspondence (`paper/CCF_Methodology/Review/`), the LaTeX submission bundle for the journal portal (`paper/CCF_Methodology/Submission/`), the local database build artefacts (`build/`), and the project archives (`Archives/`, `Prompt/`, `models/`, `modules/`) are kept strictly local — they are listed in `.gitignore` and are not mirrored on GitHub. The published database itself lives on Zenodo (concept DOIs `10.5281/zenodo.20346363` for the PostgreSQL edition and `10.5281/zenodo.20346372` for the Apache Parquet mirror, always resolving to the latest release; the v2.1.0 version DOIs are `10.5281/zenodo.22019287` and `10.5281/zenodo.22019288`), and the companion code, training data, intercoder reliability data, and manuscript sources are archived in a dedicated Zenodo code deposit (DOI `10.5281/zenodo.21921214`) and bundled with both data editions as `ccf_code_and_paper.tar.gz`.

**Conventions.** Scripts in `Scripts/Annotation/` are zero-padded so a lexicographic sort matches the execution order: 01--14 form the annotation pipeline (including the BGE-M3 sentence-embedding ingestion at step 09), and 15--17 form the reporting pipeline (CSV normalisation, revision artefacts, table generators).

## Usage

The pipeline runs end-to-end on a single Apple Mac Studio (M2 Ultra, 128 GB unified memory); only the sentence-embedding ingestion at step 09 requires substantial wall-clock time (≈ 21 GB of float16 vectors, ≈ 2 h for the COPY plus 20–40 min for the HNSW build).

## Scripts overview

### Annotation pipeline

#### 01_Preprocess.py
Segments each article into two-sentence sliding-window units using language-specific spaCy models (`en_core_web_lg` for English, `fr_dep_news_trf` for French), counts words, verifies date formats, and writes the processed CSV consumed by subsequent steps.

Dependencies: `pandas`, `spacy`.

#### 02_JSONL.py
Converts the preprocessed CSV into JSONL files for manual annotation, separating French and English sentences and stripping near-duplicates.

Dependencies: `pandas`, `json`.

#### 03_Manual_annotations.py
Reads the manually annotated JSONL, counts label usage, and exports an annotation-metrics CSV.

Dependencies: `json`, `csv`.

#### 04_JSONL_for_training.py
Prepares the manually annotated JSONL data for training: splits into train / validation sets, handles stratification for main and sub-labels, and exports annotation metrics to CSV.

Dependencies: `json`, `random`, `csv`.

#### 05_populate_SQL_database.py
Creates the local PostgreSQL database `CCF_Database` and populates it with the two original tables `CCF_full_data` (article-level metadata) and `CCF_processed_data` (two-sentence units with annotation columns).

*Due to copyright restrictions, the article-extraction code is not published.*

Dependencies: `psycopg2`, `pandas`.

#### 06_Training_best_models.py
Trains 128 BERT-base / CamemBERT-base classifiers (one per category × language) through the Augmented Social Scientist framework. The automated reinforced-training phase is triggered when the positive-class F1 falls below 0.60 during normal training; 45 of 128 models triggered the reinforcement.

Dependencies: `torch`, `pandas`, `AugmentedSocialScientist`.

#### 07_Annotation.py
Applies the trained English and French models to the entire `CCF_processed_data` table, with resumable progress, language-aware batching, and partial-result logging.

Dependencies: `torch`, `tqdm`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `psycopg2`.

#### 08_NER.py
Large-scale Named Entity Recognition (PER, ORG, LOC) on the sentence-level data. French uses spaCy (`fr_core_news_lg`) for PER and CamemBERT-NER for ORG / LOC; English uses BERT-base-NER for all three types.

Dependencies: `psycopg2`, `pandas`, `torch`, `tqdm`, `spacy`, `transformers`.

#### 09_create_sentence_embeddings.py
Ingests the BAAI/bge-m3 sentence embeddings (1024-dimensional, L2-normalised, float16) into the PostgreSQL table `CCF_sentence_embeddings` as a `pgvector` `halfvec(1024)` column, covering every sentence in `CCF_processed_data` plus every article title (stored under `sentence_id = 0`). An HNSW index on the cosine operator class is provisioned afterwards so semantic-similarity queries return in milliseconds. Execution is resumable: ingestion is skipped when the row count already matches.

Dependencies: `psycopg2`, `numpy`, `pickle`; requires `pgvector` ≥ 0.7 with `CREATE EXTENSION vector` enabled in `CCF_Database`.

#### 10_JSONL_for_recheck.py
Builds a multilingual JSONL file directly from `CCF_processed_data` for the post-deployment validation, using root-inverse weighted sampling with hard constraints to guarantee balanced representation across rare and common labels while preserving language distribution and excluding sentences seen during training.

Dependencies: `pandas`, `psycopg2`, `tqdm`.

#### 11_Annotation_metrics.py
Benchmarks the model-generated annotations against the gold-standard JSONL. Outputs a wide-format CSV with precision, recall, and F1 for each label, both classes (positive / negative), each language (EN / FR), and the combined corpus (ALL), plus micro, macro, and weighted averages.

Dependencies: `pandas`, `psycopg2`, `tqdm`.

#### 12_Blind_verification.py
Creates a blind-verification copy of a manual-annotation JSONL by wiping all labels, so the second coder can re-label without bias. Streaming I/O, robust error handling, CLI arguments with sensible defaults.

Dependencies: `argparse`, `json`, `tqdm`.

#### 13_Intercoder_reliability.py
Computes Cohen's κ, Krippendorff's α, Gwet's AC1, and percent agreement between annotation rounds. Exports detailed CSV reports with confidence intervals.

Dependencies: `pandas`, `krippendorff`, `sklearn`.

#### 14_create_intercoder_progression_plot.py
Publication-ready plot of Krippendorff's α progression across the annotation campaign, used in the methodology paper.

Dependencies: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

---

### Reporting pipeline

#### 15_normalize_categories.py
Defines the canonical category API used by every downstream script (`ALL_CATEGORIES`, `PRIMARY_CATEGORIES`, `normalize_category`, `escape_latex`, `format_code`, `get_section_headers`), normalises all training-time CSVs, and produces the legacy B-tables that map onto Supplementary Tables S4 / S5 / S7 / S8.

Dependencies: `pandas`, `psycopg2`.

#### 16_build_normalized_csvs.py
Single script for the normalised reliability artefacts under `Database/Training_data/`, orchestrated in three top-level builders:
- `build_per_category_reliability()` → `per_category_reliability_normalized.csv`: full-sample, training-phase and blind-phase Cohen's κ, Krippendorff's α, Gwet's AC1, percent agreement, and F1 agreement for every category.
- `build_reliability_tiers()` → `reliability_tiers.csv`: tier A / B / C assignment per language and overall, including the prevalence-induced reliability deflation flag and exclusion flags.
- `build_training_hyperparameters()` → `training_hyperparameters_normalized.csv` and `training_static_configuration.csv`: per-model best epoch, training phase, validation losses, per-class metrics, plus pipeline-wide static constants and campaign timings.

The script reuses the canonical category API from `15_normalize_categories.py` and writes byte-deterministic CSVs consumed by `17_generate_tables.py`.

Dependencies: `pandas`, `importlib`.

#### 17_generate_tables.py
Single script for every reproducible numerical / structural table of the manuscript and Supplementary Information:
- Main manuscript: Table 3 (training-set performance for primary detection categories), Table 4 (validation F1 macro / micro / weighted by language), the inline intercoder block for the blind-phase trio.
- Supplementary Information: S4 (complete training metrics), S5 (train / val distribution), S7 (detailed validation metrics on the gold standard), S8 (database-wide distribution, pulled live from PostgreSQL), S9 (per-category κ / α / AC1), S10 (reliability-tier assignment), S11 (per-model training hyperparameters), S12 (data dictionary of the enriched database).

Deterministic regeneration from the canonical CSVs, three-decimal formatting, automatic LaTeX escaping, reuse of the canonical category API from `15_normalize_categories.py`, and direct write to `paper/CCF_Methodology/Results/Outputs/Tables/`.

Dependencies: `pandas`, `psycopg2`, `importlib`.

### Paper figure scripts

The `paper/CCF_Methodology/Results/Scripts/` directory contains the scripts that generate the figures and the descriptive tables of the methodology paper. The directory is intentionally minimal: the manuscript is a data-descriptor, so the only scripts kept here are the ones that document what the deposited database contains.

#### 1_overview_plots.py
Overview figures: distribution of articles by media outlet, total articles per year, and choropleth map of articles by province. Reads `CCF_full_data` and writes to `Results/Outputs/Figures/`.

#### 2_temporal_f1_validation.py
Temporal F1 evolution plot showing model-performance stability across five consecutive time periods.

#### 3_data_overview.py
Data Overview artefacts (Section *Data Overview* of the manuscript): a heatmap of the mean per-article share of each main frame from 1990 to 2024, plus two LaTeX tables (article-level descriptive statistics; top-10 named entities by type). Reads `CCF_article_aggregates`, `CCF_article_entities`, and `CCF_full_data` directly from PostgreSQL.

#### generate_latex_tables.py
Generates the LaTeX framework-definition tables used in the paper.
